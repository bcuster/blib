# blib
Bradley's Better (than STL) C++ container and general tools library.

The container ADTs in blib are based strictly on pointers and not copies,
and thus out perform the comparable STL ADTs in general.
Other tools are wrappers for some C library functionality and miscellaneous
nice-to-have functionality, to make a coder's life simpler, such as date
string formatting, a text-log class and an .ini file class; all meant to
make prototyping of light-to-medimum weight projects go very quickly.
